# MyReads


### Introductions: 
A bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project is built with React.

### Functionality:
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. 

The three shelves are:
*Currently Reading
*Want to Read
*Read


Each book has a control that lets user select the shelf for that book. When user selects a different shelf, the book moves there. 


The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows user to find books to add to their library.


User can also click on the book cover to read detail infortion for that book.




### Start the project:
```
start a terminal and cd into MyReads folder
run npm install
run npm start
```
